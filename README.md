# images-stitching

In this project, I formulate stitching as a two-image matching problem, and use invariant local
features to find matches between both images. And then, run RANSAC algorithm to estimate
Homography matrix. Next, I warp one image to align for stitching. Finally, I stitching them
together. I used OpenCV tool and Python programming language to performed this project.
